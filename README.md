# The-Due-Dork-Times: Smart News for All

## Main idea for the project
I wanted to create a news website that was a bazaroo version of The New York Times. I even added in my own fake advertisement for a movie that sits above the header

If you would like to reference this from my site, you can visit The New York Times [here](https://www.nytimes.com/)

## Total time worked on Project: 8 Hours

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I had during this short project was learning the search functionality. It was my first time making a search by text box instead of a search by drop down, so it was interesting to learn how to grab values from text and search.

## Wins 
This project was very enjoyable and it allowed me to explore some of my knowledge I have gotten from Turing

## Future Feature Ideas
1.  Perhaps as a feature I could grab more than one API for articles or advertisements and display them to the user.
2.  I also could add delete functionality to the search results with a button click, instead currently you have to either refresh the main page or search something else to get different results.
3.   Add Cypress End to End testing to check for any bugs/errors
